The app uses the following technologies and libraries:

1. **Retrofit**: for making network calls to a movie API.
2. **Room**: for storing movie data locally in a SQLite database.
3. **Clean Architecture**: to separate the app into three main layers: presentation, domain, and data.
4. **Paging**: for efficient pagination and loading of movie data.
5. **Koin**: for dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and testability.
6. **Compose**: for building the user interface using Jetpack Compose.
7. **Flow**: for handling asynchronous data streams.
